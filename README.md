Hi 
The library is in development state. 
The main goal is to create high perfomance Freeswtich .NET library for handling all common known voice scenarios like: IVR, Recording, Routing, Streaming etc.

Any help is welcome.




FsBridge.ConsoleApp - app for library testing
FsBridge.FsClient - library itself
FsBridge.WpfClient - windows WPF application for calls management and library test


Thanx
